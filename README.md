## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

From this project, I learned to structure HTML according to design required to implement CSS Grid and Flexbox together. There was a lot of learning for CSS Grid, Flexbox, custom CSS properties, and how to use json to populate data from json file.

### Continued development

I'll be pixel perfecting this design to accomodate exact same as the challenge.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - This resource is handy to refer quickly for any CSS Grid properties.
- [Parsing JSON](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/json-stringify-example-how-to-parse-a-json-object-with-javascript/) - This article was helpful in recalling the concept of fetch and parsing JSON.
- [Mouse Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseover_event) - MDN was helpful in setting up mouse event for handling the hover effect.
